        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "filemanager" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...
                'filemanager',
            ]
        
        2. Include the filemanager URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            url(r'^your-url/', include('filemanager.urls', namespace='filemanager')),
        
        3. Run `python manage.py migrate` for initial migrations.
        
        4. Add STATIC_URL, STATIC_ROOT, MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT to the settings.
        
        5. Make sure the base folder defined in your settings for filemanager does exist. By default it is located at MEDIA_ROOT/uploads.
        
        5. Run `python manage.py collectstatic` to save the staticfile to your STATIC_ROOT.
        
        6. If you have 'base.html' in your project then add::
        	
        	<html>
          		<head>
        			{% block head%}{% endblock %}
        		</head>
          		<body>
            			{% block content %}{% endblock %}
          		</body>
        	</html>
